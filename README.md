Person_reID_pytorch
==============================
from Resnet-50->Part-based Convolutional Baseline
-------

some news:
---
It is consistent with the new baseline result in several top-conference works, e.g., Beyond Part Models: Person Retrieval with Refined Part Pooling(ECCV18) and Camera Style Adaptation for Person Re-identification(CVPR18). And arrived Rank@1=93.24%, mAP=80.78% only with softmax loss and Part-based Convolutional Baseline(PCB) method!\
`1`.`Random Erasing Augmentation` has been added\
`2`.`Last Stride`has been adjusted 1\
